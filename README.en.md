## Introduction

Kuayue is a Create train mod with Chinese railway style.

As a decorative and functional mod, Kuayue adds locomotives, passenger cars, freight cars, on-board and ground 
equipment that are currently in use or have been retired by the China Railway to the Create train system, and plans to 
implement a set of functional gameplay (such as scheduling, driving, etc.) according to the China Railway specifications.
